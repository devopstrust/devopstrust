# Hi there! I'm Serhii, an Aspiring DevOpsðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub page!

Iâ€™m just starting out in the world of DevOps, but Iâ€™m already passionate about automating processes, improving infrastructure, and ensuring reliable application deployments. My goal is to bridge development and operations to create efficient and resilient systems.

## A little about me:

- ðŸ”§ **Skills**: Basics of Docker, Git, CI/CD, fundamental knowledge of cloud services (AWS)
- ðŸ“š **Learning**: Currently taking courses on DevOps, actively exploring tools and industry best practices
- ðŸŒ± **Interests**: Process automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), monitoring, and logging
  
## My Projects:

Here you'll find some of my first projects. I'm open to suggestions and collaboration!

- **Web Application Deployment Automation**: Using Docker and Jenkins to set up a simple CI/CD pipeline.
- **Monitoring Setup with Prometheus and Grafana**: Basic configuration for tracking application metrics.
- **LEMP Stack Deployment: Automated the deployment of a LEMP stack using Ansible.
- **ELK Stack Setup: Configured and deployed an ELK stack for centralized logging and monitoring.
